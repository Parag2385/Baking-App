# Baking App
![Travis-ci](https://api.travis-ci.org/Parag2385/Baking-App.svg)

Here is a fully functional and colorful android app which I made from scratch for Android Developer Nanodegree program. This app reveals the power of adaptive UI both for phone and tablet devices. 
This app will allow Udacityâ€™s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. 
It will also allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.

### Features:

  - Discover the recipes of Miriam
  - Step by step guide
  - Watch videos for the steps
  - Material design
  - Adaptive UI for both phone and tablet
  - Widget for ingredients
